Description: EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation tool
 Exiv2 can:
 .
  * print the Exif metadata of JPEG, TIFF and several RAW image formats as
    summary info, interpreted values, or the plain data for each tag
  * print the IPTC metadata of JPEG images
  * print, set and delete the JPEG comment of JPEG images
  * set, add and delete Exif and IPTC metadata of JPEG images
  * adjust the Exif timestamp (that's how it all started...)
  * rename Exif image files according to the Exif timestamp
  * extract, insert and delete Exif metadata, IPTC metadata and JPEG comments
  * extract, insert and delete the thumbnail image embedded in the Exif metadata
  * fix the Exif ISO setting of picture taken with Nikon cameras

Description: EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation library
 Exiv2 library supports:
  * full read and write access to the EXIF and IPTC metadata of an image
    through Exiv2 keys and standard C++ iterators
  * a smart IPTC implementation that does not affect data that programs like
    Photoshop store in the same image segment
  * EXIF MakerNote support:
    o MakerNote tags can be accessed just like any other EXIF metadata
    o a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the MakerNote:
  * extract and delete methods for EXIF thumbnails (both, JPEG and TIFF
    thumbnails)
  * set methods for EXIF thumbnails (JPEG only, TIFF thumbnails can be set from
    individual tags)
  * complete API documentation (by Doxygen)
  * generic lower-level classes to access IFD (Image File Directory) data
    structures
